# AiiDAlab - Empa Surfaces app

The Empa Surfaces AiiDAlab app enables the user to prepare and run automatic AiiDA workflows for calculations relevant in on-surface chemistry.
Features include:

* generating various metal slab geometries;
* geometry optimizations of adsorbed systems, bulk systems and isolated molecules;
* chains of constrained geometry optimizations;
* Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations;
* GW calculations for isolated systems;
* ...
